# Contributing

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Contributions should be made via pull requests. Pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers and merged when acceptable.

The goal of the Public Holidays API is to provide a curated database of public holidays that can be easily accessed publicly.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow best practices and explain the context of the problem and how it was solved -- including any caveats or follow-up changes required. They should tell the story of the change and provide readers an understanding of what led to it.

[How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) provides a good guide for how to do so.

In practice, the best approach to maintaining a nice commit message is to leverage a `git add -p` and `git commit --amend` to formulate a solid change set. This allows one to piece together a change, as information becomes available.

If you squash a series of commits, don't just submit that. Re-write the commit message, as if the series of commits was a single stroke of brilliance.

That said, there is no requirement to have a single commit for a pull request, as long as each commit tells the story. For example, if there is a feature that requires a package, it might make sense to have the package in a separate commit then have a subsequent commit that uses it.

Remember, you're telling part of the story with the commit message. Don't make your chapter weird.

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the app, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/naXa777/PublicHolidaysAPI/issues/new).

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/naXa777/PublicHolidaysAPI/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
